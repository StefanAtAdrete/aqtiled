# Cookiebot - Cookie consent, Cookie monitoring and Cookie control

This module offers Drupal integration for the third party Cookiebot service.
Cookiebot helps make your use of cookies and online tracking GDPR and ePR
compliant.

Note: Neither Cookiebot or this module will out-of-the box prevent cookies to be
placed on your website or prevent other tracking technologies to run. However,
the JavaScript events or special HTML attributes of Cookiebot can be used by a
developer to achieve exactly that.

For a full description of the module, visit the
[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/cookiebot).
